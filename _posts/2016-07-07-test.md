# Testing Out My New Blog
This is my second Jekyll theme I've tried.

I'm also using (trying to use) a Rakefile from <url>https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-rake-boilerplate.git</url>.

I chose to use Jekyll for a few reasons

* Learn more about Web standards and models
   * CSS
   * HTML
   * Javascript
* Learn Ruby
* Code snippets
* Free hosting on Github

## Code Snippet Test

{% highlight python linenos %}
import numpy as np
from numba import jit

@jit
def iter_mean(data):
    """
    calculate a mean using iterative method.
    `data` is an array like object.
    """

    mu = np.float64(mu)

    for i in range(len(data)):
       mu += 1.0 / (i + 1) * (mu - data[i])

    return mu
{% endhighlight %}
