# Background
I was given a compiled library from a collaborator who isn't keen on handing out
source code. The programs worked in a Docker container but that wasn't going to
work for my lab's distributed computing model.

I needed a way to change where the binaries expected the libraries to be. luckly my
group's IT manager came by and showed my how to do it.

# The names have been Changed
I've changed the names of all the programs involved to avoid NDA complications and other
unwanted public discloures.

The binary package is called, `FooBarPackage` that has two library dependencies,
`Intel` and `BazLib`.

# Fixing Compiled Binary Library Paths
FooBarPackage was shipped compiled with Intel and BazLib.

We need to be able to tell the programs inside of FooBarPackage to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
The program `ldd` will show us which libraries the programs depend on and if they are found.

We'll start fixing a single program contained in FooBarPackage, named  `FooBin`.

{% highlight bash %}
ldd FooBarPackage/FooBin
    linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffc0faae000)
    BazLib_struct.so => not found
    BazLib_dt.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    libIntel_stuff.so => not found
    libguide.so => not found
    libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007ff0dea00000)
    libstdc++.so.6 => /lib64/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007ff0de6f7000)
    libm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00007ff0de3f5000)
    libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007ff0de1de000)
    libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff0dde1c000)
    /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff0dec64000)
{% endhighlight %}

Library components like this one `BazLib_struct.so` can be fixed using an environment variable.
But not `/path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so`.

We can fix the two `BazLib_struct.so` and `BazLib_dt.so` with this:
`/export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/FooBarPackage_src/FooBarPackage/libs`.

Once we do however, we'll see *MORE* fully specified paths to Intel components. Fully specified paths are bad because `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` won't fix them.

## The Fix
The fix is to remove the directory name from those fully specified paths so that setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will
allow them to be found.

*example*
`/path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so` will become `libIntel_foobaz.so`.

We must do that for *all* the binaries in FooBarPackage. But that's not all....

The complex part of this, is that the libraries themselves, call each other, and use full paths. So we need to not only fix the binaries, but also the libraries themselves.

### Examine the library files

{% highlight bash %}
for i in *.so;do
    echo $i
    ldd $i | grep 'path' | sort | uniq
done
{% endhighlight %}

*output*
{% highlight bash %}
BazLib_dt.so
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found

BazLib_struct.so
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
libimf.so
libsvml.so
{% endhighlight %}

There's only 3 `so` files to fix from two indirect calls coming from: `BazLib_struct.so` and `BazLib_dt.so `.

#### Intel directory
Check all the `so` files for bad paths:

{% highlight bash %}
for i in *.so;do
    ldd $i | grep "not found"
done
{% endhighlight %}

Note "not found" did not occur and hence we don't need to fix these at all.

# patchelf
Not found in the `yum` repository. Instead of adding another repo for Jed to maintain he compiled it from source. It was easy as I recall.

## Patch the Binary `FooBin`
The utility `patchelf` is pretty easy to use. The changes are made in-place.

{% highlight bash %}
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so libIntel_foobaz.so FooBin
10143  patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so libIntel_stuff.so  FooBin
10144  patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so libIntel_core.so   FooBin
{% endhighlight %}

## libs dir
Only two of these libraries need to be fixed, `BazLib_struct.so` and `BazLib_dt.so`.

{% highlight bash %}
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so libIntel_foobaz.so BazLib_dt.so
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so libIntel_foobaz.so BazLib_struct.so
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so libIntel_stuff.so  BazLib_dt.so
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so libIntel_stuff.so BazLib_struct.so
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so libIntel_core.so  BazLib_dt.so
patchelf --replace-needed /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so libIntel_core.so BazLib_struct.so
{% endhighlight %}

## The Intel Library
Luckily, these do not need any hacking at all.

# Fix All Binaries
Now we need to run `patchelf` on the remaining binaries.

Make some variables for looping a bit later:
{% highlight bash %}
bad_dir="/path/that/doesnot/exist"
stuff="libIntel_stuff.so"
core="libIntel_core.so "
foobaz="libIntel_foobaz.so"
{% endhighlight %}

Make a list of binaries:

{% highlight bash %}
list=($(find . -maxdepth 1 -type f))

for bin in ${list[@]};do
    echo $bin
    ldd $bin | grep "pubsw" | sort | uniq
done
{% endhighlight %}

*output* with some errors and non essential lines removed:
{% highlight bash %}
./segMasks
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./invertDisplacementField
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./reg
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./FooBin
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./dvRev
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found

./applyLocalScaling
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./averageImage
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./applyTransforms
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./restrictImage2Mask
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./roiDv
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
./invertAffMatrix
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_core.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_foobaz.so => not found
    /path/that/doesnot/exist/libIntel_stuff.so => not found
{% endhighlight %}

We can see it's the same three libraries again.

## Loop over the binaries

{% highlight bash %}
for prog in ${list}; do
    for lib in ${stuff} ${core} ${foobaz}; do
        echo "running $prog lib $lib"
        patchelf --replace-needed ${bad_dir}/${lib} ${lib} $prog
    done
done
{% endhighlight %}
