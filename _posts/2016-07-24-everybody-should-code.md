I do not consider "coding" to mean actual programming. So now we can discard the idea that everyone ahould be a programmer. [Coding Horror](https://blog. codinghorror.com/please-dont-learn-to-code/) put it well, but honestly that was obvious.

## Stepping Back in Time
The first word processor I learned to use was Word
Perfect on an IBM XT. That's pre 286. I've nerver used a better word processor
since. My mother was a secretary at the time in downtown SF and brought home
the XT. She taught me the basics of DOS and WP.

My mother is 73 years old and still works in marketing and PR. She always
started as secretary and ended working for a company as a manager. She also
taught me to type in WP using `reveal codes`.

## What is Coding Then?
In this context, I'm refering to coding as using a
[markup](https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Markup_language) language like `html`,
or,`markdown`. It could by Linux's `roff`, `troff` or `groff`.  Wikipedia is
written using the Mediawiki markdown.

## Fast Forward
So yes, I think everyone should be able to type in at least one
markup language. There is no pressure to become a programmer, an IT manager, to
setup the server that uses this markup text. I just think it's too valuable and
easy to learn, to not know how to write directly for a blog, wiki, or something
else.

## Liberal Arts Majors and Writers
If you consider yourself a writer of any sort then you probably care a lot
about type setting. Type setting done with LaTeX or someother markup
language is much faster than a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) program
such as Word or an Adobe product.

Fancy yourself a blogger or journalist? Then learn some markup. It's not that
hard and you'll have much more control of your type setting and will not rely
upon licensed software. I don't suggest switching to Linux right away. However,
if you hit hard economic times and your MAC dies, then it's helpful to be able
to run a 5 year old computer with a free OS and still typeset your work.

## As Long As We Are On Topic
Getting away from the mouse and trackpad is another
worthwhile endeavor. Young people don't need to learn to program per se, they
need to be comfortable in the programming envirnonment.

## Teaching Kids About Computers
I've read some rather uninteresting articles about teaching children about programming in grade school. Below is my list of priorities for young people learning about practical computing.

* Learn to keyboard, AKA typing class
* Learn a Markup langauge
* Learn to use EMACS, VI, or some other system that doesn't use a mouse
* Still interested
    * Learn the C programming language
        * Write for loops and old school fizz buzz programs
    * Learn a modern language
        * Python
        * Ruby
        * Java
    * Learn elementary algebra
        * Get comfortable with Abstraction
            * Using letters and words as place holders for other
            * Builds foundation for a lot of logic
