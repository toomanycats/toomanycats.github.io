I need to work in Python 3 more and stop being lazy. I setup my conda environment for Python3 a while ago and haven't used it all that much. The new ipython 5 has helped me to reenforce my new habit since I love working in a terminal.

Issues:

* conda complained about a missing .pth file
    * solved with: `pip install --upgrade --ignore- installed`
        * [issue link](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2751)
* My VI keybindings broke in the ipython terminal
    * solved with : _pending_


## Pretty Pictures: Code Highlighting
```source activate py3
ipython
```

## More ipython 5 goodness
I've been stubbornly using Python2.7 for a while and one thing I hate is trying to edit a function definition on the terminal that I've already defined.

I don't know when this feature came about but now you can just cursor where ever you want in the function def.
