I need to work in Python 3 more and stop being lazy. I setup my conda environment for Python3 a while ago and haven't used it all that much. The new ipython 5 has helped me to reenforce my new habit since I love working in a terminal.

Issues:

* conda complained about a missing .pth file
    * solved with: `pip install --upgrade --ignore- installed`
        * [issue link](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2751)
* My VI keybindings broke in the ipython terminal
    * solved with : _pending_
