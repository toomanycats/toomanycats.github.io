I had a chance to try out Windows 10 recently on a brand new Dell laptop that
had hardly been used. To be brief, I wasn't impressed at all...

## Watching A Movie:With some hassles to solve
My sister in law (SIL) was over and we decided to watch the original 1984 Ghost
Busters in preparation for a movie night with the rest of the family. It turns
out I had a copy on my Linux machine that I hadn't watched yet and didnt' know
for sure what the quality was going to be.

SIL has a new Dell Inspiron with a big screen to watch movies. So I thought
it'd be cool to try it out. There were a few steps we had to perform.

* Transfer the movie file from my Linux machine
    * Use an external hard drive
        * install HFS+ reader
* Watchthe Movie
    * Player got stuck
        * Try a more reputable player
            * install SMplayer
                * Get 7z utility
    * Back to Linux

I suggested we copy the movie to an external hard drive so that we can use the
new W10 machine. SIL says, "I have one given to me from my old roomate". I plug
the external 1TB USB 3.0 spinning iron HD into my Ubuntu laptop. It mounts and
I copy the movie over. Painless.

Now I plug the USB 3.0 device into the Dell and get a cryptic error message,
something about the USB device was not recoginized. Hmmmm, OK, maybe the hard
drive is from a MAC ? I look for the web browser in W10 to search out a way to
mount the suspected HFS+ formatted drive.

## Get On the Internet

I click in the tray the new stylized "E" that I'm told is for the Edge browser.
Well, whatever the case, it doesn't do anything. No error messages. I click on
the "E" a few times and it flashes, but no browser shows up. I hunt thorugh the
program directory and find Internet Explorer and run it.

## Reading HFS+ From Windows 10

Now I look for a program to allow reading of HFS+ filesystems since I'm pretty
sure that is the problem. I find this nifty website
[makeuseof](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-read-mac-formatted-drive-windows/)
with four ways to work around this problem. Only one is free and required
installing Java. Didn't feel like dealing with that so I took [Paragon HFS+ for
Winsows](http://www.paragon-software.com/home/hfs-windows), with a 10 day trial
period.

Downloaded the program from Paragon and installed it. Plug the external drive
back in and now it's read perfectly fine as it was on my Linux box. I copy
Ghost Busters from the external to the laptop, it copies over quickly.

## Watching the Movie

At 27 min 34 seconds the movie stops. No error no mothing, just frozen screen
and the CPU fan is running. The movie was encoded in xxx with xxx container. I
figure it might be better to use Windows media player. No go, same problem at
the same place in the movie.

## Try Another Player I'm a lover of mplayer in Linux and I know there's an
SMPlayer front end for Windows. I try to download it. I go back to sourceforge
and download SMplayer which comes compressed in 7z format. Windows doesn't ship
with 7z utilities. I search for a 7z utility and try the "app store" thing. No
luck. Not only do we need a pin which SIL forgot, it doens't appear to have a
7z utility.

Back to sourceforge, find a 7z utility and decompress the SMPlayer installer. I
have issues getting 7z to decompresss. At this point, it's getting late and we
decide to stop the experiment and just watch the movie in Linux. I double click
on the icon which starts Totem, not my favorite media tool but typically
sufficient.

I scroll ahead to minute 27 where the movie got stuck before, and there's not
problem at all. Not even a hiccup. We watch the rest of the  movie on my laptop
and call it a night afterwards.

## Linux

I didn't know for sure if the issue was with the player or the movie file
itself. Before getting too excited, I start Ghost Busters in my Linux default
movie player "".

## Conclusion You may say that I didn't have the computer that well setup. You
say say that reading HFS+ files systems is not standard for Windows. You may
say that I simply struggled with a new computer.

However, I think that Windows is just junk. The hot keys are weird ( not Emacs
or VI compatiable), it doesn't read any other file system other than NTFS or
FAT32 natively (neither does OSX). The interface's borrowed from smart phones
like the "app atore" appears to have little or no value. Error messages are
lacking. Out of box play was poor.

I'm super biased. I don't deny it. I love Linux. I've had good experiences with
Windows 7 for my media server in the past. But this W10 just wasn't impressive
to a Linux guy at least.
